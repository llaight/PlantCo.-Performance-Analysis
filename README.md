### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.
4. Calculating the YTD and PYTD of the company's sales, profit, and quantity.
5. Determining the overall company's gross profit margin

## Key Insights

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1. The PYTD ( Previous Year To Date) sales are slightly higher with  $3.71 M compared to the YTD (Year To Date) which only has $3.57M

2. In terms of gross profit, the company is generating 39.15% profit from its sales

3. Regarding the Sales by Country it shows that China is the highest contributing country by a margin with $449.21 M followed by Brazil with $119.75 M and the Phillippine with $105.43 M

4. In regards to the YTD VS PYTD by Month, the graph shows fluctuations in the performance of the company, in which the recent years 2023-2024 show a large decrease

5. Lastly, in the YTD and Gross Profit Percentage by Account, it seems that some accounts contribute to high sales but operate at a lower gross profit margin, while others are more profitable but have fewer sales, this indicates that not all sales are equally profitable
